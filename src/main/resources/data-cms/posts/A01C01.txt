<p>The site is still in progress, so you will see constant changes to the design and layout. But hang on, we are in fast paced progress in stabilizing it. The organization is about making education better for students, teachers and institutions. To be more precise, we are for promoting liberal educational values, that brings interesting and relevant material to the pupils so that they could get ahead in learning simply for the joy of it. And it would bring much deserved relief to teachers and institutions by making the idea of educating the most pleasurable of occupations. Find more about us in the About us Section.
